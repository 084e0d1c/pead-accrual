# Post Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD) & Accrual Anomaly

This notebook aims to examine if the [Accrual anomaly (Balakrishnan Et al,2009)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1793364) and [PEAD (Dechow Et al, 2011)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1510321) still exist today. 

I've opted to exclude the months of COVID-19 due to extreme volatility in the market and influx of liquidity introduced.<br>
Because of data unavailability, the investigated timeframe is only from 1st Jan 2017- 1st Jan 2020. <br>
The holding period for each stock will be monthly and the rebalancing is done at the end of each month.
